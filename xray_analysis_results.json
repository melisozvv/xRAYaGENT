The most clinically relevant metric for this is the Cardio-Thoracic Ratio (CTR), which requires accurate segmentation of the heart and thoracic cavity. ChestXRayAnatomySegmentation is designed for fine-grained anatomical segmentation and can extract the CTR directly, making it the optimal tool for this query.
