## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xRAYaGENT.git
cd xRAYaGENT

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.xray_agent import EnhancedXrayAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = EnhancedXrayAgent()

# Process a query
result = agent.process_query(
    image_path="data/xray.jpg",
    query="What pathologies do you see in this chest X-ray?"
)

# Access results
print(result['analysis']['reasoning'])  # GPT-4.1 analysis
print(result['generated_code'])         # Generated Python code
print(result['result'])                 # Execution results
```
